/* The inherit CSS keyword causes the element for which it is specified to take the computed value of the
property from its parent element. It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand all.

For inherited properties, this reinforces the default behavior, and is only needed to override another rule.
For non-inherited properties, this specifies a behavior that typically makes relatively little sense and you
 may consider using initial instead, or unset on the all property.

Inheritance is always from the parent element in the document tree, even when the parent element is not the
 containing block.
