HTML5 is the newest version of Hyper Text Markup Language. The first web browser was
introduced in 1993 and the name was MOSAIC. The development of MOSAIC was at the NCSA
(National Center for Supercomputing Applications). Later it was discontinued to
development on 7th of January 1997. Still the people were using the nonstandard version
of HTML.

The standard version came into existence in 1995, when HTML 2.0 was announced. Later after
two years HTML 3.0 and after two years HTML 4.01 was announced. And still we are using the
milestone of HTML 4.01.

The First Draft of HTML5 Was announced in January 2008. And amazingly HTML5 has a broad
browser support. Though the HTML5 is still under developing phase. And a lot of organizations
are working and planning for the development of HTML5.

We canâ€™t expect the HTML5 may be the future of Web Designing, but we can say that this is the present
of Web designing. Before the development of HTML5, we were in compulsion to work in Photoshop and
Flash application, but with the development of HTML5, these affords has been reduced. Also a feature we
can use is the 3D image with <canvas>, the special designed paragraph with <article> and many more.
