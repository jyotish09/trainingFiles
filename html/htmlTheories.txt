FYI : For examples refer the example html file

Empty HTML Elements :

    Empty elements (also called self-closing or void elements) are not container tags —
that means, you can not write

        <hr>some content</hr> or <br>some content</br>.

    A typical example of an empty element, is the <br> element, which represents a line break.

        <p>This paragraph contains <br> a line break.</p>

Nested HTML Elements :

    Most HTML elements can contain any number of further elements, which are, in turn,
made up of tags, attributes, and content or other elements.

        <p class="example">Here is some <em>emphasized</em> text.</p>

HTML Attributes :

    Attributes define additional properties of an element.

        <div class="example">...</div>

        eg: id, style, hidden, bgcolor

    Custom Attributes
        A new feature being introduced in HTML 5 is the addition of custom data attributes.

        A custom data attribute starts with data- and would be named based on your requirement.
        Following is the simple example −

        <div class="example" data-subject="physics" data-level="complex">
           ...
        </div>

HTML Events :

    User do things like click on text and images and given links, hover over things etc. These
    are examples of what JavaScript calls events.

    Window Events : onload - script - Fires when the document has finished loading.
    Mouse Event : onclick  - script - Fires when the user clicks the left mouse button on the element.
    Form Events : onsubmit - script - Fires when a form is submitted.

HTML Forms :

    They are required to collect different kinds of user inputs, such as contact details like
    name, email address, phone numbers, or details like credit card information, etc.

    Forms contain special elements called controls like inputbox, checkboxes, radio-buttons,
    submit buttons, etc. Users generally complete a form by modifying its controls
    e.g. entering text, selecting items, etc. and submitting this form to a web server for processing.

HTML5 Canvas :

    The canvas element can be used to draw graphics on the webpage via scripting (usually JavaScript).
    The canvas was originally introduced by Apple for the Mac OS Dashboard widgets and to power graphics
    in the Safari web browser. Later it was adopted by the Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera. Now the
    canvas is a part of the new HTML5 specification for next generation web technologies.
